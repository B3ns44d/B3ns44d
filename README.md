# Hey there! I'm Abdessamad 👋

I'm a **DevOps Specialist** by day, and a **surfing enthusiast** by... whenever I’m not coding. 🌊🏄‍♂️

## About Me:
- 💻 I write code, break stuff (on purpose), and fix it... most of the time.
- 🎓 Instructor in Python & DevOps – because sharing knowledge is caring.
- 🥊 When I’m not coding, I’m probably throwing punches, lifting weights, or pretending to be good at chess.
- 🌍 I dream of **surfing across the globe** (and deploying some apps along the way).

### Let’s connect:
If you love DevOps, surfing, or just bad puns, feel free to reach out! 🏄‍♂️
